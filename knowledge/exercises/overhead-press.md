# Overhead Press - Exercise Knowledge Base

## Overview
The overhead press is a fundamental upper body strength exercise that targets the shoulders, triceps, and core. It involves pressing weight from shoulder level to overhead in a controlled motion.

## Ideal Form Parameters

### Starting Position
- **Feet**: Shoulder-width apart, planted firmly
- **Core**: Engaged and braced
- **Shoulders**: Retracted and down
- **Elbows**: At 90° angle, directly under the bar
- **Wrists**: Neutral, straight alignment with forearms

### Movement Phases

#### Phase 1: Setup (0-1 seconds)
- **Elbow Angle**: 90-100°
- **Shoulder Position**: Neutral, packed
- **Core**: Fully engaged
- **Breathing**: Deep inhale, hold

#### Phase 2: Press (1-2 seconds)
- **Elbow Angle**: 100-180° (progressive)
- **Bar Path**: Straight line overhead
- **Shoulder Movement**: Upward rotation
- **Core**: Maintain bracing

#### Phase 3: Lockout (2-2.5 seconds)
- **Elbow Angle**: 170-180°
- **Shoulders**: Fully extended
- **Head**: Neutral, looking forward
- **Core**: Still engaged

#### Phase 4: Descent (2.5-4 seconds)
- **Control**: Slow, controlled lowering
- **Elbow Angle**: 180° to 90°
- **Breathing**: Controlled exhale

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### 1. Insufficient Elbow Height
**Detection**: Elbow angle < 90° at start
**Risk Level**: High (shoulder impingement)
**Correction**: "Lift your elbows higher"
**Cue**: "Elbows up, under the bar"

### 2. Forward Bar Path
**Detection**: Bar drifts forward during press
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Correction**: "Press straight up"
**Cue**: "Bar over your ears"

### 3. Excessive Back Arch
**Detection**: Lower back hyperextension
**Risk Level**: High
**Correction**: "Tighten your core"
**Cue**: "Ribs down, abs tight"

### 4. Incomplete Lockout
**Detection**: Elbow angle < 170° at top
**Risk Level**: Low
**Correction**: "Full lockout overhead"
**Cue**: "Push the ceiling away"

### 5. Asymmetrical Press
**Detection**: Left/right elbow angle difference > 15°
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Correction**: "Keep both arms even"
**Cue**: "Press evenly"

### 6. Neck Protrusion
**Detection**: Head moving forward
**Risk Level**: Low
**Correction**: "Keep your head back"
**Cue**: "Make a double chin"

## Safety Considerations

### Pre-requisites
- Adequate shoulder mobility
- No shoulder/neck injuries
- Basic core strength

### Injury Prevention
- Always warm up shoulders thoroughly
- Start with bodyweight or light weight
- Progress gradually
- Stop if shoulder pain occurs

### Modifications
- **Seated Press**: For lower back issues
- **Dumbbell Press**: For shoulder asymmetries
- **Partial Range**: For mobility limitations

## Coaching Progressions

### Beginner Cues
1. "Feet shoulder-width apart"
2. "Elbows up and under"
3. "Press straight up"
4. "Full lockout"
5. "Control the descent"

### Intermediate Refinements
1. "Drive through your heels"
2. "Squeeze your glutes"
3. "Create tension throughout"
4. "Bar over your ears at lockout"

### Advanced Optimizations
1. "Generate power from the ground up"
2. "Maintain upper back tightness"
3. "Time your breathing"
4. "Explosive up, controlled down"

## Form Scoring Criteria

### Excellent (90-100)
- Perfect elbow positioning
- Straight bar path
- Full range of motion
- Controlled tempo
- Stable core

### Good (80-89)
- Minor bar path deviation
- Slight asymmetry
- Good control overall

### Acceptable (70-79)
- Moderate form issues
- Still safe execution
- Some coaching needed

### Poor (60-69)
- Multiple form breaks
- Safety concerns present
- Immediate coaching required

### Dangerous (<60)
- High injury risk
- Stop exercise immediately
- Major corrections needed

## Biomechanical Analysis

### Joint Actions
- **Shoulder**: Flexion and abduction
- **Elbow**: Extension
- **Wrist**: Stabilization
- **Core**: Isometric contraction

### Muscle Activation
- **Primary**: Deltoids, triceps
- **Secondary**: Upper trapezius, serratus anterior
- **Stabilizers**: Core, upper back

### Force Production
- **Peak Force**: At 120-140° elbow angle
- **Sticking Point**: 100-120° elbow angle
- **Acceleration Phase**: 140-180° elbow angle

## Rep Detection Criteria

### Rep Start
- Elbow angle < 100°
- Stable position maintained
- Movement initiation detected

### Rep Completion
- Elbow angle > 170°
- Momentary pause at lockout
- Controlled descent begins

### Quality Thresholds
- **Full Rep**: Complete range of motion
- **Partial Rep**: >50% range of motion
- **Failed Rep**: <50% range of motion

## Real-time Feedback Priority

### Critical (Immediate Voice)
1. Elbow angle < 85° (injury risk)
2. Excessive back arch
3. Loss of control

### Important (End of Rep)
1. Incomplete lockout
2. Bar path deviation
3. Asymmetrical press

### Minor (End of Set)
1. Tempo issues
2. Breathing patterns
3. Minor technique refinements

## Adaptive Coaching

### Beginner Focus
- Safety first
- Basic movement pattern
- Range of motion
- Simple cues

### Intermediate Focus
- Technique refinement
- Power development
- Consistency
- Progressive overload

### Advanced Focus
- Efficiency optimization
- Performance metrics
- Competition preparation
- Periodization
