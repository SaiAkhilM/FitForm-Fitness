# Boxing Combo (Jab-Cross-Hook) - Exercise Knowledge Base

## Overview
The jab-cross-hook combination is a fundamental boxing sequence that develops hand-eye coordination, power generation, and defensive positioning. It combines three distinct punches in a fluid, powerful combination.

## Ideal Form Parameters

### Starting Position (Orthodox Stance)
- **Feet**: Left foot forward, shoulder-width apart
- **Knees**: Slightly bent, bouncing slightly
- **Guard**: Hands up, elbows in
- **Head**: Chin down, eyes up
- **Weight**: Balanced, slight forward lean

### Movement Phases

#### Phase 1: Jab (0-0.3 seconds)
- **Left Hand**: Straight extension from guard
- **Right Hand**: Stays in guard position
- **Shoulder**: Left shoulder protraction
- **Hip**: Minimal rotation
- **Footwork**: Step with left foot (optional)
- **Return**: Quick snap back to guard

#### Phase 2: Cross (0.3-0.6 seconds)
- **Right Hand**: Straight extension with rotation
- **Left Hand**: Returns to guard
- **Shoulder**: Right shoulder drives forward
- **Hip**: Full rotation (45-90°)
- **Weight**: Transfers to front foot
- **Power**: Generated from ground up

#### Phase 3: Hook (0.6-1.0 seconds)
- **Left Hand**: Horizontal circular motion
- **Elbow**: 90° angle maintained
- **Shoulder**: Left shoulder rotation
- **Hip**: Counter-rotation back
- **Pivot**: Left foot pivots
- **Target**: Side of opponent

#### Phase 4: Recovery (1.0-1.2 seconds)
- **Guard**: Both hands return to position
- **Stance**: Reset to ready position
- **Head**: Movement and positioning
- **Breathing**: Controlled exhale

## Common Mistakes and Corrections

### 1. Dropping Guard
**Detection**: Hand position below chin level
**Risk Level**: High (defensive vulnerability)
**Correction**: "Keep your hands up"
**Cue**: "Protect your face"

### 2. Poor Hip Rotation (Cross)
**Detection**: Minimal hip turn < 30°
**Risk Level**: Medium (power loss)
**Correction**: "Turn your hips into the punch"
**Cue**: "Drive with your back foot"

### 3. Overreaching Punches
**Detection**: Full arm extension on all punches
**Risk Level**: Medium (balance/power loss)
**Correction**: "Don't overextend"
**Cue**: "Punch through, not at"

### 4. Slow Hand Return
**Detection**: >0.2 seconds return to guard
**Risk Level**: High (defensive gap)
**Correction**: "Snap your hands back"
**Cue**: "Touch and return"

### 5. Flat-Footed Movement
**Detection**: No bounce or movement
**Risk Level**: Low (mobility issue)
**Correction**: "Stay light on your feet"
**Cue**: "Bounce and move"

### 6. Poor Hook Mechanics
**Detection**: Elbow angle > 120° or < 60°
**Risk Level**: Medium (power/safety)
**Correction**: "Maintain elbow angle"
**Cue**: "Elbow at 90 degrees"

### 7. Tension in Shoulders
**Detection**: Raised shoulder position
**Risk Level**: Low (speed/endurance)
**Correction**: "Relax your shoulders"
**Cue**: "Loose and fluid"

## Safety Considerations

### Pre-requisites
- Basic boxing stance knowledge
- Hand wrap usage
- Adequate shoulder/wrist mobility
- Cardiovascular fitness

### Injury Prevention
- Always use proper hand wraps/gloves
- Warm up thoroughly
- Progress intensity gradually
- Focus on technique before power

### Common Injuries
- **Wrist strain**: From poor punch alignment
- **Shoulder impingement**: From overuse
- **Hand injuries**: From improper protection

## Coaching Progressions

### Beginner Cues
1. "Stand in boxing stance"
2. "Hands up, protect your face"
3. "Jab straight out and back"
4. "Cross with hip rotation"
5. "Hook in a circular motion"

### Intermediate Refinements
1. "Coordinate your footwork"
2. "Generate power from your legs"
3. "Keep your opposite hand up"
4. "Flow between punches smoothly"

### Advanced Optimizations
1. "Vary your timing and rhythm"
2. "Use feints and setups"
3. "Integrate head movement"
4. "Develop knockout power"

## Form Scoring Criteria

### Excellent (90-100)
- Perfect guard maintenance
- Optimal power generation
- Flawless technique sequence
- Superior timing and flow
- Maximum efficiency

### Good (80-89)
- Minor guard lapses
- Good power and technique
- Occasional timing issues
- Overall solid execution

### Acceptable (70-79)
- Moderate technique flaws
- Adequate power generation
- Some defensive gaps
- Basic competency shown

### Poor (60-69)
- Major technique issues
- Poor power generation
- Significant defensive lapses
- Needs substantial work

### Dangerous (<60)
- High injury risk
- Fundamental flaws
- Poor protective posture
- Immediate correction needed

## Biomechanical Analysis

### Power Generation Sequence
1. **Ground Force**: Leg drive initiation
2. **Hip Rotation**: Core power transfer
3. **Shoulder Drive**: Upper body contribution
4. **Arm Extension**: Final power delivery
5. **Hand Position**: Target connection

### Defensive Positioning
- **Non-punching Hand**: Always in guard
- **Head Movement**: Subtle positioning
- **Chin Protection**: Down and covered
- **Body Positioning**: Angled and mobile

## Combination Timing

### Optimal Rhythm
- **Jab**: Quick, snappy (0.3s)
- **Cross**: Powerful, driven (0.3s)
- **Hook**: Smooth, circular (0.4s)
- **Total Time**: 1.0-1.2 seconds

### Flow Characteristics
- **Smooth Transitions**: No pauses
- **Maintained Guard**: Throughout combo
- **Consistent Power**: Each punch effective
- **Recovery Ready**: Immediate defense

## Rep Detection Criteria

### Combination Start
- Proper stance established
- Guard position verified
- First jab initiated

### Combination Completion
- All three punches executed
- Guard position restored
- Stance reset achieved

### Quality Thresholds
- **Perfect Combo**: All elements correct
- **Good Combo**: Minor flaws present
- **Poor Combo**: Major technique issues

## Real-time Feedback Priority

### Critical (Immediate Voice)
1. Guard down (defensive risk)
2. Poor balance/stance
3. Overreaching dangerously

### Important (Between Rounds)
1. Hip rotation issues
2. Hand return speed
3. Power generation problems

### Minor (End of Session)
1. Rhythm and timing
2. Footwork refinements
3. Breathing patterns
