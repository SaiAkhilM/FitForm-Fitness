> **AI-Powered Personal Trainer with Real-Time Form Analysis**

FitForm Fitness revolutionizes fitness training by combining computer vision, IoT sensors, and AI coaching to provide real-time form correction and personalized feedback. Our app delivers professional-grade biomechanical analysis typically only available to elite athletes.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

**85% of gym injuries** are caused by poor form and technique. Traditional fitness apps only count reps - **we analyze how you move** and provide instant corrections to prevent injury while maximizing results.

## 🚀 Key Innovation
